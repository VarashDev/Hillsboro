<h2>
    <strong>Top Lakes &amp; Ponds for Bass Fishing</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Bethany Lake</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    A go-to for <strong>largemouth bass</strong>, this well-stocked urban pond presents comfortable bank fishing with docks and vegetation. Rig Texas-style soft plastics or spinnerbaits around cover and drop-offs.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Commonwealth Lake Park</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Another <strong>bass hotspot</strong>, this scenic park lake holds healthy largemouth populations. Ideal for spinners, creature baits, and topwater action near weedlines and inlets.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Salish Ponds (Fairview)</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    While often known for trout, <strong>West Salish Pond</strong> also supports bass. Fish in shallow zones during summer, focusing on lily pads and reed edges with frogs or soft plastics.
</p>
<h2>
    <strong>Rivers &amp; Sloughs: Smallmouth Bass Territory</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Tualatin River Sloughs</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Just south of Hillsboro, the <strong>Tualatin River and sloughs</strong> provide great <strong>smallmouth bass</strong> fishing. Cast from kayak or shore along riprap, docks, and deeper channels using crankbaits, spinnerbaits, or drop-shot rigs.
</p>
<h2>
    <strong>Bank vs. Boat: Which is Best?</strong>
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Bank Fishing</strong>: Offers easy, no-boat-needed access at lakes and rivers with trails and docks.

    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    An affordable float tube or kayak significantly boosts access and catch rates.
</p>
<h2>

        <strong>Soft Plastics</strong>: Senkos, creature baits rigged Texas or Wacky—ideal near cover.
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Spinnerbaits &amp; Jigs</strong>: All-season favorites around structure and submerged wood.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Finesse Jigs &amp; Worms</strong>: For pressured fish and tough bites, especially in winter.
