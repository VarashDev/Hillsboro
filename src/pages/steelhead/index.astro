<h2>
    Introduction: Why Hillsboro Is a Great Base for Steelhead Fishing
</h2>
<p>
    Located in the heart of the Tualatin Valley, <strong>Hillsboro, Oregon</strong> is under an hour from three major steelhead fisheries: the Clackamas, Sandy, and Columbia Rivers. These waters offer both winter and summer runs, for both wild and hatchery fish. Whether you're fishing from the bank, drifting bobbers, or swinging flies, there's consistent steelhead opportunity throughout the year.
</p>
<h2>
    Understanding Steelhead Runs in Northwest Oregon
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Winter Steelhead</strong>: Migrate December–March. Cold, high-flow rivers bring aggressive fish to the banks and drift reaches.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Summer Steelhead</strong>: Run May–October. These fish move slowly upstream, often in clearer, lower water—allowing for stealthy presentations.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Many Oregon streams are now continually stocked, particularly the Sandy and Clackamas, increasing angling options year-round.
</p>
<h2>
    Best Rivers for Steelhead Fishing Within 45 Minutes
</h2>
<h3>
    Clackamas River
</h3>
<p>
    Just 25 minutes east of Hillsboro, it delivers strong summer steelhead action. Good access exists near <strong>Riverside Park</strong>, <strong>High Rocks</strong>, and <strong>Barton Park</strong>. Drift and bank spots offer success depending on flow.
</p>
<h3>
    Sandy River
</h3>
<p>
    Known for hatchery-supported winter runs, this river peaks during December–March. Key access at <strong>Oxbow Regional Park</strong>, <strong>Cedar Creek</strong>, and <strong>Dabney</strong>.
</p>
<h3>
    Columbia River (Troutdale area)
</h3>
<p>
    Driven flows off the Gorge create prime holding water for wild and hatchery steelhead. Launch from <strong>Chinook Landing</strong>or fish banks around <strong>Troutdale</strong> and <strong>Rooster Rock State Park</strong>.
