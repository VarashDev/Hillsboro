<h3>
    <strong>1. Clackamas River</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Just southeast of Portland (30–45 min drive), offering some of the <strong>most reliable winter and summer steelhead fishing near Hillsboro</strong> 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Seasons</strong>: Winter steelhead: <strong>January–mid March</strong>; Summer steelhead: <strong>May–August</strong> 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Best access points</strong>: Barton Park, Carver Park, Riverside Park, McIver State Park, River Mouth 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Tactics</strong>: drift fishing with cured roe, plunking spinners or Spin‑N‑Glos, bobber fishing near eddies and seams
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Why fish here</strong>: Strong hatchery returns, good infrastructure, and plentiful bank &amp; boat access.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>2. Sandy River</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Flows through Troutdale and Gresham (under 45 min from Hillsboro), excellent for <strong>winter and summer hatchery steelhead</strong> 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Seasons</strong>: Winter runs peak from <strong>late December through February</strong>, with summer steelhead arriving around <strong>May–July</strong> 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Key access</strong>: Oxbow Regional Park, Dodge Park, Lewis &amp; Clark Park, Cedar Creek (hatchery zone), Revenue Bridge
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Note</strong>: Hatchery fish are aggressive; native wild fish must be released.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>3. Lower Willamette River (Quad City / Gladstone)</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        As the <strong>Clackamas confluence zone</strong>, Willamette near <strong>Meldrum Bar</strong> sees winter steelhead congregating before entering tributaries 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Season</strong>: Especially productive <strong>December–February</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Fishing style</strong>: Shore plunking with Spin‑N‑Glos or drift rigs.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>4. Columbia River (Lower Gorge / Sauvie Island)</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Offers a <strong>summer steelhead fishery</strong> (May–August), often combined with salmon fishing 
    </li>
    <li>
        Accessible spots: Sauvie Island beaches, Reeder Road, Government Island.
    </li>
    <li>
        Anglers typically <strong>plunk spinners or spoons</strong> from shore or drift small craft in calmer sloughs.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>5. Coastal Rivers (Wilson, Nestucca, Nehalem)</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        About <strong>90–120 minutes west</strong> of Hillsboro; these rivers support <strong>year‑round or long-duration wild winter steelhead runs</strong> 
    </li>
    <li>
        Easily accessible along <strong>Highway 6</strong> and popular with wading anglers. Great alternative for less pressure and wild fish.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    &nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Peak action</strong>: Clackamas and Sandy deliver top fishing in winter; Willamette is best for shore-driven winter steelheading; Columbia is a solid summer option 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Overlap</strong>: Winter &amp; summer runs sometimes overlap in spring (“shoulder period”)&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Recommended Techniques &amp; Gear
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Summer steelhead</strong> (clearer, lighter flows): finesse tactics like swinging flies, small spoons, light spinners (~4–9 g), or roe drift setups in deeper pools.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Winter steelhead</strong> (high, muddy water): heavier rods (9–10 ft spinning), bright lures (pink/orange jigs or spinners), Spin‑N‑Glos, and bobber-float with cured eggs 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Fly fishing</strong>: Intruder and bead-drop patterns swung in tailouts and seams during summer steelhead season.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Time of day</strong>: First light and dusk are peak bite hours regardless of method .
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Access &amp; Logistics
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Bank vs. Boat</strong>: Sandy and Clackamas both offer boat ramps (e.g., Oxbow, Carver, McIver), but bank fishing is common and effective at most parks 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Crowds</strong>: Meldrum Bar and Cedar Creek eastbank attract many anglers. For more solitude, head to upper Clackamas tributaries or Sandy upriver from Oxbow.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Family-friendly</strong>: Oxbow Regional Park is ideal for bank anglers and beginners—recent Reddit threads praise it for easy access and predictable early-season action&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Licenses &amp; Regulations
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Required</strong>: Oregon Angling License + Combined Angling Tag.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sandy River &amp; Columbia tributaries: <strong>Columbia Basin Endorsement</strong> needed 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Take rules</strong>: Only hatchery fish (with clipped adipose fin) may be retained. All wild steelhead must be released
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Hook restrictions</strong>: Barbless hooks often required; bait regulations may vary by section—check ODFW before heading out.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Angler Tips &amp; Insights
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Start at river mouths</strong>: “Begin at the mouth of Clackamas or Sandy and work upstream until you find fish” — popular advice among local anglers
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Adapt conditions</strong>: When Clackamas is mud-blown, smaller tributaries like Eagle Creek often offer fishable water earlier in the season 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Local tackle shops and ODFW reports</strong>: invaluable for current conditions, run timing, and gear suggestions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Shift tactics by run</strong>: brighter colors in winter, natural/soft-presentation summer; wading in morning and evening more effective in warm months.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Final Take
</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Best steelhead waters near Hillsboro</strong> include:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Clackamas River</strong> – the most consistent go‑to for both winter and summer runs, with excellent access.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sandy River</strong> – scenic, productive, and reliable for hatchery steelhead nearly 8–10 months of the year.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Lower Willamette (Meldrum Bar)</strong> – winter hotspot for bank anglers as steelhead stack up before entering Clackamas.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Columbia River (Lower Gorges / Sauvie Island)</strong> – great for summer steelhead and combined salmon trips.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Wilson &amp; Nehalem Rivers</strong> – longer drives (~90 min), but deep wild runs and less pressure.
    </li>
</ol>
