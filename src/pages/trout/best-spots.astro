<h3>
    <strong>Bethany Lake (a.k.a. Bethany Pond)</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Located just north of Hillsboro—stocked each spring with hundreds to thousands of legal-size rainbow trout 
    </li>
    <li>
        About 10 acres, with paved pathways and shoreline access. Best fishing in <strong>March–May</strong> right after stocking. Great for beginners and families. .
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>Progress Lake</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        A 10-acre former quarry pond in Beaverton with cold, deep water keeping trout active longer seasonally 
    </li>
    <li>
        Regularly stocked in spring. Ideal for spin or fly anglers. Quiet and peaceful finish.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>Commonwealth Lake</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Another Washington County park near Beaverton offering trout along with panfish. ADA‑accessible and nice for kids. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Stocked seasonally—check ODFW stocking schedule.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Nearby Reservoirs and Mountain Lakes
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Henry Hagg Lake</strong> (~40–50 minutes west)
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        One of the most heavily stocked lakes in the region—over 60,000 trout annually, with fish averaging 10 inches and occasional trophy bows above 5 lbs. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Excellent for trolling, casting spoons, spinners, PowerBait, and fly fishing. Great from <strong>March through June</strong>, with a fall resurgence as water cools.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>North Fork Reservoir &amp; Oak Grove Fork Clackamas River</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        North Fork Reservoir is stocked May–September with legal rainbows; released wild trout species upstream must be released. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Oak Grove Fork has rainbows, brook, cutthroat, and brown trout. Only artificial lures and flies allowed, barbless hooks. Great fly-only trout fishing.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>Timothy Lake</strong> (~1–1.5 hr east in Mt. Hood NF)
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Scenic and remote, offers rainbow trout, wild cutthroat, brook trout, browns, and kokanee salmon. Fly or spin fishing is productive at inlets and south shore areas.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Wild Trout Streams &amp; Creeks
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Upper Tualatin River &amp; Tributaries (Gales, McKay, Dairy Creeks)</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        These Class 1 mountain streams near Hillsboro host native cutthroat trout. Often fly/artificial only zones with catch-and-release rules 
    </li>
    <li>
        Access is spotty—bridge crossings and road pullouts provide entry. Expect smaller but wild, feisty trout.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>South Fork Clackamas River</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        A remote tributary reached via modest hiking. Holds wild trout in scenic surroundings. No migratory fish above waterfall barrier. Primarily catch-and-release fishing on public forest land. .
    </li>
</ul>

    Urban ponds offer consistent early action in spring. For wild trout, late summer or fall is best in mountain streams.
</p>
<h2>
    Gear &amp; Techniques
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Stocked ponds/lakes</strong>: Ultralight spin gear, PowerBait, nightcrawlers, small spoons or spinners.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Reservoirs &amp; larger lakes</strong>: Medium spinning or fly rods—troll small spoons, inline spinners, or cast with salmon eggs.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Fly fishing</strong>: Use dry flies, nymphs, and streamers in creeks and tributaries. In Oak Grove Fork, fly-only rules apply.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Creek streams</strong>: Small #12–16 midges, caddis larvae, Muddler minnows; stealthy presentation is key.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Regulations &amp; Licensing
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Oregon fishing license</strong> required for anglers age 12+; trout tags not needed for stocked lakes. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Catch limits</strong>: Typical daily trout limit is 5 fish in stocked waters. Creeks may have stricter rules (e.g., catch-and-release, barbless hooks). .
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Check ODFW stocking maps and weekly fishing report</strong> to time your trips and confirm openings or restrictions.
    </li>
</ul>
