    Top Rivers for Salmon Fishing Near Hillsboro, Oregon
</h2>
<h3>
    Willamette River (Newberg, Wilsonville access)
</h3>
<p>
    Only 30–40 minutes from Hillsboro, this stretch of the <strong>Willamette River</strong> is a productive spring Chinook fishery. Boat anglers troll herring or spinners, while bank anglers cast bobber-and-egg setups.
</p>
<h3>
    Columbia River (Scappoose, St. Helens)
</h3>
<p>
    The <strong>Columbia is the powerhouse</strong> of Oregon salmon fishing. Launch from Scappoose Bay or bank fish near St. Helens for <strong>fall Chinook</strong> and <strong>Coho</strong>. Troll spinners, Super Baits, or fish from anchor using Kwikfish.
</p>
<h3>
    Multnomah Channel
</h3>
<p>
    A hidden gem close to Sauvie Island, this slow-flowing side channel is a popular spot for <strong>spring Chinook</strong>. Less boat traffic and smoother currents make it ideal for trolling plug-cut herring or prawn spinners.
</p>
<h3>
    Clackamas River
</h3>
<p>
    Known for a <strong>strong Coho salmon run</strong>, the lower Clackamas also hosts fall Chinook. Bank anglers target spots near Riverside Park or High Rocks with spinners and bait setups.
